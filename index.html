  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I Live in Tampa, Fl where I graduated from East Bay High School in 2017 and went to work at Amazon for almost 6 years.
    Thanks to Amazon I was able to attend the Correlation One Program to learn software programming so that I can have a better future for myself.
    My goal is to work for a company like Microsoft or even Amazon's AWS division and continue to expand my knowledge in programming and learn from the best.
    I enjoy competetive gaming, Anime, and all things nerdy. I'm familiar with the hardware aspects of a computer but I want to learn more about the software part of it.
